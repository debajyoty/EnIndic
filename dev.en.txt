This notice has been placed on the DTO office delivery counter . 
It is clear that the DTO office itself accepts that DLs are being delivered after one month , while the service act specifies that the deadline is seven days . 
This means that within seven days of application the DTO office has to give the finished DL to the applicant . 
If we talk about the reality on the ground then the situation is even worse . 
There are very many applicants to whom the DL has not been delivered even after 1 month . 
The number of applicants who are being moved around the office for two to three months are countless . 
You can get an idea of how bad the situation is in the office from the fact that DTO Anil Garg does not have any information regarding the notice on the delivery counter .

This fact was revealed after the investigation by the Environment Protection Board . 
The investigation that was conducted last year at different places , during Diwali , showed that the noise pollution reached a level of 100 decibels . 
On an ordinary day it is usually 55 decibels . 
Every year the noise pollution level increases due to the noise of the firecrackers or loud DJ music . 
Even after the restrictions imposed by the government people are continuing to sell and buy high decibel crackers openly . 
The management and prevention of the above activities is the responsibility of the local S . D . M , but they avoid this responsibility even when needed . 
The Environment Protection Board had measured the noise pollution near the traffic police station last year during Diwali . 
The investigation was done before Diwali on the 10th of November at different times . 
The minimum noise level was found to be 72 . 5 decibels and the maximum 83 . 6 decibels . 
Similarly , during Diwali , on the 13th of November 2013 , the maximum sound level was 87 . 7 decibels and the minimum was 80 decibels . 
During Diwali a maximum of 100 . 3 decibels of noise pollution was recorded and the minimum was 72 . 1 decibels . 
On an ordinary day the maximum level of noise pollution recorded was 65 decibels , while the minimum was found to be 55 decibels . 
Unfortunately , people don ' t care about the level of increased noise pollution and continue to buy high decibel firecrackers .

Shobhan Sarkar has said that the rock has been found and as soon as it is broken up the SSI officers will find out the truth about the treasure .

At the same time he said , and shocked everyone by saying , that until he is called to the excavation site the gold will not be found . 
When asked about the differences in his comments he became annoyed and started accusing the Government and the SSI , talking about what exactly is being done at the excavation site and that the media is being banned from entry there . 
We had demanded a live telecast of the excavation . 
However , he did agree that the SSI excavation team is digging on the right spot , as he had indicated .

The reply date for the notice is fixed for the 12th of November .

Dynasties such as Chandragupta Mauraya , Ashoka etc . , are examples of ancient national unity . 
There is a long list of iconic men who fought against foreign armed attacks and rulers . 
Vivekananda , Dayanand , Tilak , Gandhi , Subhash , Patel , Lohia , Bipin Chandra , Ambedkar etc . , and Bhagat Singh , Chandra Shekhar Azad make a long list of immortal martyrs , but Congress has only been giving credit for nation building to the Nehru - Gandhi family . 
The bigger lie is the more effective . 
Out of the 58 central schemes 16 have Rajiv Gandhi ' s name on them . 
The list of other schemes , awards , airports and institutions with the Nehru family name attached to them is long . 
Now preparations are being made to name even the Public Distribution System i . e . , the PDS scheme , after Indira Gandhi . 
The names of such iconic men have been inspiring . 
Naming streets , universities or airports after them is welcome , but to name the rural housing scheme of the national capital ' s international airport is not acceptable under any circumstances . 
The public distribution system has already been brought into disrepute . 
Who is stopping the Congress from asking for votes in the name of this scheme ? 
But what is the problem in looking beyond the Nehru family , when it comes to naming ? 
Many competing arguments were exchanged between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the main opposition party prime ministerial candidate , Narendra Modi , about the greatness of Sardar Patel . 
Patel is a great nation builder . 
He joined 562 states into one nation . 
Patel belongs to everyone , he is loved by the whole of India , but Congress has made him their own property . 
The public distribution system may be named after Patel too . 
This will not affect the importance of Patel in any way . 
Congress has been in power for a long time . 
The politicisation of the schemes was done by Congress itself . 
Congress was once a democratic party , with democratic leaders like Tilak , Gokhale , Gandhi , Subhash , Rajendra Prasad , Nehru , Patel and Madan Mohan Malviya . Since 1950 , it has come under a single family ' s control . 
Party and Family have become synonymous . 
To proclaim family and country synonymous the slogan ' Indira is India ' was created . 
The naming of the schemes has also become a household matter . 
Government schemes are run from the accumulated exchequer , from the country ' s taxpayers . 
The nation ' s exchequer is not the property of any single family in Congress . 
Following the example of Congress each party created their own icons . 
The regional parties ran schemes in the names of politicians as they wish . 
Everyone has icons , but the list of party icons kept increasing . 
Currently , every small or large party has its own icon . 
Government schemes are not run in the names of political leaders in America . 
Their justification in India is pathetic . 
The centre plans to take the credit for all the schemes by running the schemes in the names of the Nehru family . 
Schemes in the names of Mahatma Gandhi , Patel , Subhash Chandra Bose or Bhagat Singh ' s cannot be identified with the identity of Congress . 
Congress has moved away from its heritage . 
Only preaching or messages from Rahul - Sonia seem to work for Congress . 
Of course the other parties also name their schemes the same way , but they do not stick to one family ' s name for every scheme . 
The politicization of social welfare schemes is condemnable . 
The laptops distributed in Uttar Pradesh have the picture of the SP chief on them . 
Of course , the voters give the majority winning party the right to make policies . 
The government is bound to the planning and implementation of their duties , but the taxpayers and voters definitely do not give the government the right to name the schemes as they wish . 
Voters expect governance from the government not politics , and taxpayers expect the proper transparent use of the exchequer . 
The misuse of the exchequer is a constitutional offence . 
Some kind of naming protocol has to be developed . 
Political leaders are not the solution to everything . 
India is full of multi - talented geniuses . 
The names of the institutes of higher education / research institutions must named after talented Indian scientists . 
A philosopher ' s name or a distinguished author ' s name will be appreciated for literature , philosophy or the art institutes . 
There is a lack of a sense of history in politics . 
There was also a long debate on naming the country in the constituent assembly . 
Seth Govinddas , Kamalapati Tripathy put forward ' Bharat ' . 
The name Bharat received 38 votes and India received 51 . 
The fundamental question is : why is no serious thought given to the naming of the schemes ? 
Why is politics always involved in this ? 
Why is such importance given to one single family ? 
Why not make a list of common public approved names ? 
Joint committees of Parliament and the legislature may also be used to create a list . 
Why is there gross negligence at both the national and state levels in naming the schemes ? 
Due to this negligence , the young generation is forgetting the names of our freedom fighters . 
There are different types of heroes . 
Some are created by TV and mostly are biased with political prejudice . 
Naming is a cognitive exercise . 
In the " Jnyansukta " of the Rigveda , naming has been called the beginning of knowledge . 
Naming the schemes well can be inspirational . 
Memorising names of great people from general knowledge books is an act of labour , but naming the government schemes , streets or important places after inspiring personalities is the easiest tool for reviving a the sense of history . 
Names like Gandhi Nagar , Patel Airport , Ambedkarpuram or Vivekanandapuram add an historicalinspiration . 
In a recent survey conducted just two to three months ago , it was shown that half of the country ' s villages and cities are associated with the name of Rama . 
Extra vigilance is required in naming the country , period , culture , civilisation and history . 
Their names become representative of specific expressions and approaches . 
Dayananda , Vivekananda and Gandhi ' s names are synonyms with social reform , Vedic philosophy truth and non - violence , respectively
The Friends of Congress are requested to overcome their addiction of looking for names from the same family . 
There are many names in Indian history with a golden glow . 
The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal has ordered that Rs . 50 . 67 lakhs compensation should be paid to the family of the former Minister of Maharashtra , Shrikant Jichkar , who was killed in a road accident in 2004 . 
The family had demanded Rs . 25 . 82 crores . 
The family had said that the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation [ MSRTC ] bus driver ' s negligence caused the death of Jichkar on the 2nd of June 2004 . 
Along with ordering the MSRTC to pay the compensation the Tribunal said that the insurance company should not pay anything as the car belonged to Jichkar himself . 
The family of Shriram Dhavadh , Jichkar ' s lecturer friend ' s family , will also receive compensation of Rs 21 . 60 lakh . 
He also died in the same accident . 
Out of this , approximately 70 percent of the amount ( Rs . 15 . 12 lakhs ) will be paid by the MSRTC . 
The driver of Jichkar ' s car was also found guilty of negligence and hence the remaining 30 percent ( Rs . 6 . 48 lakhs ) will be paid by the former minister ' s family .

Hundreds of connections from subdivisions number one and two from the Cant and Babyal substations have been disconnected . 
Because of this , the crowd of disconnected consumers is increasing at electricity offices . 
Consumers are disturbed . 
One of the problems is that the Power corporation is not accepting part - payments .

On Friday the government lowered the import duty on gold to $ 440 per 10 grams and has increased the import duty on silver to $ 738 per kilogram . 
This change has been made after taking into consideration the international fluctuation of prices in both the precious metals . 
Customs duty has been levied on the value of precious metals . 
Two days ago the import duty on gold was increased to $ 442 per 10 grams , while the cost price of silver was kept constant at $ 699 per kg . 
Generally the prices of precious metals are reviewed every fortnight , but because of the volatility in the international commodity market these prices have been changed .

When the crackdown on passengers without tickets started , the passengers count increased to 39 , 000 . 
Jaipur . Due to a shortage of passengers , the Railways administration started intense checking in the trains and this has resulted in the increase of the passengers count up to 39 , 000 in a single month . 
The Railways administration believes that passengers without tickets are now worried about getting caught and now they are travelling with a ticket . 
The CPRO of the Railways , Tarun Jain , says that 9 lakh 75 thousand passengers in the reserved category and 88 lakh 13 thousand passengers in the unreserved category travelled last year in the month of October .

Stung by the Supreme Court decision the Rural Development Minister , Jairam Ramesh , said that the practice of exceeding their powers by the court is dangerous . 
On Thursday , the court said in a ruling that civil servants should not act on verbal commands from their political masters . 
On Friday Jairam said that it is not right for the Courts to exceed their powers and take the job of the officers and the Government into their own hands . 
In a " Meet the Press " held at Kannur in Kerala , Jairam said that this is not a decision . 
This is a verbal order from the Supreme Court . 
For this purpose the Central Government ' s Civil Service Establishment Board is already in place . 
The sudden revelation of a group of retired officers will result in many such decisions . 
He said , " This is a dangerous trend promoted by the retired officers and social workers " . 
Strongly attacking the Supreme Court he said , " The Supreme court wants democracy and an open environment in the country , but when it comes to appointing the judges everything is kept separate . " 
Taking a strong stand against the officers who filed the petition for the interference of the Supreme court against the insult by the political lords of bureaucracy , he said that the retired officers are filing Public Interest Petitions in large numbers , even though they served the political lords very well when they were in office .

He said that such decisions require political will and strong decision making . 
Seven years ago , the Supreme Court issued an order on police reform . 
That order was of a similar nature . 
Ask yourself whether those orders were followed in the states ?

Chandigarh : On one hand the Punjab government has passed the special bill in the Punjab for the safety of the properties of NRI Punjabies , while on the other hand emigrant Punjabies have fresh problems in Canada . 
The Canadian government is questioning NRIs about the income from their properties and the amount they received as pension , etc . from the Punjab or India . 
Through a special unit , the Federal government questioned pension holders in Canada about the income they are earning from their properties in other countries . 
The Government is receiving these kinds of complaints and information about people who came from abroad who are receiving all the financial benefits in Canada . 
According to Canadian law , after obtaining Canadian citizenship the income received from abroad must be added to their total income , but people are not doing it . 
Even after obtaining Canadian citizenship , thousands of people from the Punjab have not declared their income from properties and pension benefits , etc . in the Punjab , in their Canadian income tax returns . 
Many Revenue department officials are continuously asking the Canadian Chartered Accountants to force foreigners to declare their income which they are earning in other countries , so that they can calculate the appropriate tax on the income they are earning in Canada . 
A delegation of the Association of Seniors ' club met with an MP from Punjab , Param Gill and demanded security for their benefits in this regard . 
Param Gill says that , as per the information provided to him , if any person makes a complaint against any other person regarding this issue to Revenue Canada then his / her income can be investigated but he does not have any concrete information about the investigation . 
This Delegation also met with MPP Wick Dhilon earlier and soon they will also meet with other MPs and MPPs .
